Reflection

In this project, I built a Vanilla Javascript stopwatch application. The Stopwatch application implements basic javascript functions like setInterval, clearInterval etc as well as custom functions that makes use of event listeners like onClick etc

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are Vanilla Javascript, HTML, SAAS SCSS, and CSS. I chose to use the SAAS SCSS in order to avoid code repetition which can lead subtle mistakes or mix ups. Instead the SCSS file is transpiled into CSS on clicking watch. It helps to bundle repetitive style properties into a form of object that can simply be passed around as needed.
